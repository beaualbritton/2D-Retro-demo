#### 2D Platformer RPG Demo

#### Summary
This program is a simple, 2D platforming RPG supposed to resemble old NES style games from the 1980s. This game
comes fully equipped with an in-depth textbox and battle system, 52 enemies you can battle, as well as multi-state screen logic.

The goal of this game is to move your character to the topmost red square in the `play` state. This is an enemy, and you are supposed to fight them.
Once the player makes contact with the enemy, a new encounter is generated. The battle will play out until one character perishes or the player runs. 
All other directions are found in the game itself, it comes equipped with information for the player at the start and in-battle. 


Video and code (that was added) documented robustly.
